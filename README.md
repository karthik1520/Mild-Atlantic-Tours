The Mild Atlantic Tours (MAT) application, developed using the simplicity of C#, goes beyond basic data entry for bus drivers and includes an added feature for generating a summary of their daily transport activities. The single-form interface remains user-friendly, allowing drivers to input their name, bus ID, and the number of passengers, while also providing an option to view a summarized report.

In addition to the passenger count fields, the application incorporates a summary feature that aggregates the data entered by bus drivers. This summary functionality enables MAT personnel to gain a quick overview of their daily operations, showcasing the total counts of full, student, and child passengers.
